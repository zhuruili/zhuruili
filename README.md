# RookieNoob

Hi there! 👋

I'm just an ordinary university student with big dreams. 💭  
Despite my self-doubt, I'm on a mission to achieve financial freedom before the age of 35, so I can live life on my own terms. 💸  
Until then, I'm navigating the challenges of student life and figuring out my path to success. 📚
